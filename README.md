# OT-Editor

This will be unorganized for the time being...
This is the text editor web front end for my operational transformation project. Operational transformation is a method for maintaining consistency and concurrency in collaborative editing of documents. The [wikipedia page for operational transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) may be of assistance in understanding the concept.

This project will initially just be the front end for the editting of a single document that other clients can connect to and collaboratively edit in real time. Once this is completed and the OT process is fine-tuned, I will surround this project with a login/session management. Users will be able to create new documents and invite other users to be able to view and edit the file. This project will be a work in progress for awhile. This readme will also be updated frequently to reflect new plans. Furthermore, users will be able to download the file.
